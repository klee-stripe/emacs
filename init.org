* Tangling Hook
  There are two main approaches to writing your emacs configuration in
  org-mode:
  - ~org-babel-load-file~. This approach is very simple to implement,
    but has to tangle each file when emacs starts.
  - ~org-babel-tangle~. This approach stores the tangled file on disk,
    but you have to remember to re-tangle after each edit.


  We can use a file-local after-save-hook to do the tangling
  automatically. However, this file variable is not considered safe by
  default, so emacs will prompt you the first time you open this
  file.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
    (setq safe-local-variable-values '((eval add-hook 'after-save-hook
                                             (lambda nil (org-babel-tangle))
                                             nil t)))
  #+END_SRC
